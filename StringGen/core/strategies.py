"""
Strategy implementations for SCA string generation.

This module implements the five generation strategies described in the paper:
1. INSET1 - Repeat single character n times
2. INSET2 - n unique random characters from one set
3. CROSS1 - n unique random characters across all sets
4. CROSS2 - Distributed characters from three sets concatenated
5. CROSS3 - Shuffled version of CROSS2

Performance optimizations:
- Pre-allocated string buffers using bytearray for O(1) append operations
- Optimized random sampling using numpy where available
- Minimal memory allocations through object pooling
- Vectorized operations for bulk character generation
